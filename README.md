## Project Status

MVP completed according to requirements - this app is only intended for learning and practicing with Node, Express, routing and API creation.
Post-MVP: I'm currently working on put and delete routing that will bring the application up to a fully working CRUD status. In addition, I would like to link with a second, exisiting api (potentially wikipedia) and allow uses to access further data on the author's of the quotes.
